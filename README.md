# learning_arb_go

This is my first attempt at learning golang. This work was done around ~july-august 2021.
I used what I had learned so far in my learning_arb project and rewrote it in go with the goal of increased speed and learning a new language.
I quickly started encountering null pointers and was very confused tracking them down. While working on this I started looking into rust and with 
the combonation of the rust book, compiler and documentaion, I found myself enjoying learning rust much more than go and have been learning and loving
rust ever since.
